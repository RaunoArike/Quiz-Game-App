## Code of Conduct
In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.

## Assignment description:
In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group on this course.

We need to build a successful, working application by working together in an efficient way. We must be able to present and explain our product as a team and ensure that everyone contributes to the different parts of the application.  

## Target or ambition level: 
What grade are you working for?

We are aiming for a minimum grade of 8.0, and even better if possible. 

## Products:
What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?

We should deliver the source code of the working application such that it can be built and run by a client. The code will be in GitLab, together with the documents relevant to both the process and the final application. The standards we must meet are that our code must be properly tested, with the agreed-upon standards for code style. 

## Planning:
How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submit it to Brightspace on behalf of the project group?

We meet every week to make sure that everyone is aware of the deadlines of the week and submits them on time. We upload the relevant deliverables on GitLab and everyone submits the same document from GitLab to Brightspace if it is needed. 

## Behavior:
How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?
 
If someone is late during a group meeting, we try to contact the person. If they are late by a substantial amount of time (10 or more minutes) then we begin without the person and help them catch up later with what they missed. If we have conflicts within our team we will try to discuss and resolve them with a vote. We will seek the TA’s guidance if needed. 

## Communication:
In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (In the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)

We use Mattermost for official communication with the TA. Unofficially, we communicate through WhatsApp to schedule meetings outside of the weekly mandatory meeting with the TA. During the meetings we discuss in person, and if needed we use Zoom to link with a person who cannot attend.

## Commitment:
How do you determine the quality of each group's work, so that each group delivers the same quality?
How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

The chairs and the minute takers’ commitment is seen through the documents they submit, i.e. the agenda and the minutes of the meeting. We also seek feedback on their work to ensure that it is of adequate quality. We measure the quality of each individual’s contribution by code reviews and ensuring that the code has been thoroughly tested.

## Meetings:
How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?

As a group we meet twice a week - once with the TA and once informally by ourselves. For the meetings with the TA the chairman prepares an agenda. For the informal meeting there is no defined preparation, although we expect that we have finished previously agreed upon tasks. 

## Decision-making:
How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

We try to make decisions by consensus whenever we can, but if it appears impossible, we try to reach a decision through a majority vote.

## Dealing with conflicts:
How do you handle conflicts within the group?

We try to resolve the conflicts by discussing the things we do not agree on in order to reach a consensus. If it is not possible, we may talk with the TA and ask for help.

## Guidance:
What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

We would like to receive feedback on both the content and the collaboration. The TA facilitates a discussion of what each individual member contributed every week, this ensures that everyone is contributing and actively collaborating. We would also like to receive feedback on the product we are working on, and to check that we are on track to complete the product on time. 

## Consequences:
What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep to the agreements?

We try, as individuals, to all contribute equitably to the project itself. If someone does not keep their agreement, we seek to converse with the TA in order to find the best way to pursue our project.

## Success Factors:
What makes your team a dream team?

We aim for everyone to have a positive experience with the project and be satisfied with our work as a team and development as individuals at the end. This is in addition to delivering a successful product and we believe this factor is what makes us highly motivated towards this project.
